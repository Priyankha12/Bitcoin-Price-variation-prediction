# Bitcoin-Price-variation-prediction
In this project, I predicted the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency. The predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make the predictions I used the machine learning technique of Bayesian Regression for Latent Source Model,  and implemented this technique in Python.
